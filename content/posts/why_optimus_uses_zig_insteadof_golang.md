Hello everyone :-) One of my projects - [Optimus](https://github.com/nxy7/optimus) - aims at making monorepo projects easier to manage. It's nothing fancy really, but I've always thought that having clear way to structure monorepo (with some extra benefits like caching test results if no inputs changed) would be nice, but all solutions require significant investment into their ecosystem to use them correctly. [Optimus](https://github.com/nxy7/optimus) instead provides clear way to structure monorepos and is extensible via shell scripts.
